This is the personal website of Eliza Schultz.

I write long-form analysis of current events and historical topics. While I do my best to present factual information, I am not neutral. I am a union worker and a Marxist-Leninist. My research and writing here is not for abstract scholarship but to provide useful information in the struggle to defeat capitalism and all oppression, and ultimately to bring about freedom and socialism.
