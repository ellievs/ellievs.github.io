# Maya Forstater #
In December 2019 a controversy arose following a tweet by J.K. Rowling which decried the firing of Maya Forstater for “stating that sex is real”. Forstater had made tweets indicating that she would refuse to use trans people’s pronouns, because of her belief that “biology is fact”, meaning that gender can not be changed. She was fired for these tweets, and in court the firing was upheld as her absolutist views of gender were considered inherently hostile to the workplace.

While Forstater has tried to frame this as a free speech issue, what is interesting to us is the [statement](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/18/judge-rules-against-charity-worker-who-lost-job-over-transgender-tweets) indicating her view of sex and gender:

“My belief … is that sex is a biological fact, and is immutable. There are two sexes, male and female. Men and boys are male. Women and girls are female. It is impossible to change sex. These were until very recently understood as basic facts of life by almost everyone.”

While she attempts to root her argument in the realm of biological fact she quickly betrays where her argument lies. When she says that “men..are males” that is the symbolic categories are determined by biology, we should read it the opposite way as biology being determined by symbolic categories.

Symbolic categories rely on historically determined languages. An example is the Hijra in South Asia, who have been granted the status of a third gender by several governments. During the 19th century in the west there are examples of non-heterosexual behavior being classified as a third gender. These examples indicate the fluidity of the symbolic categories of gender, indicating that there is no anchor to biology. Biology instead must be thought of as totally contingent and can not be a source of human meaning.

Instead we must delve into the realm of how human meaning functions, through an exploration of thoughts.

# The Sex Binary #

A number of scientists (one example [here](https://twitter.com/eugenegu/status/1207683933229342720)) responded to the controversy, pointing to the existence of intersex people as a refutation of the claim that “there are two sexes, male and female”.

Sexual neuroscientist Debra Soh provides [a typical response](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2018/10/31/science_shows_sex_is_binary_not_a_spectrum_138506.html) to this line of argumentation. First that intersex people are a statistical anomaly which is an exception that proves the rule of the binary nature of sex. She goes on to argue that sex and gender are biologically essential identities, caused by prenatal hormones. She points to [a 2005 study](https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00843.x) which found that prenatal hormones were the determinate cause of gender-typical toy play.

In interesting challenge to binary sex comes from bone researcher Alexander Kralick who discusses the indeterminate sex of many [human remains](https://slate.com/technology/2018/11/sex-binary-gender-neither-exist.html).

Molecular biologist Liza Brusman approaches this from multiplicity of sexual [genetic structures](https://massivesci.com/articles/sex-gender-intersex-transgender-identity-discrimination-title-ix/).

The [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/transgender-ideology-riddled-contradictions-here-are-the-big-ones) put out a piece seeking to discredit the transgender movement by pointing to contradictions in how activists understand the nature of sex and gender. The article is filled with many claims built on presuppositions, but does point to one contradiction: Is gender identity biologically determined and immutable or self-created and changeable. This contradiction has presented itself as a struggle within the trans movement itself.


# Language #

It isn’t clear why anatomy or chemistry should play any role in our social organization, especially if we accept the Enlightenment principle that all humans are equal.

It is appropriate that the major faultline is around pronouns. The question that doesn’t get commonly asked, is why in our language our basic identifier of other humans is gendered.

The strength of this line of argumentation is that it forces the biological essentialists to assert their real position, as to what social characteristics they are reading back into biology.

# Transmedicalism #

There has been a search for a male or female brain, to give a biological basis to transgender identity. (Natlie Wynn’s retort was to reorient from the brain to dysphoria, noting that few people get their brain’s scanned, but all trans people instead rely on psychiatric evaluation)

The problem here is exactly as aligned above. Neurological distinctions are a scientific observation, which does not inherently imply any human meaning in language. We can not understand identity and social role from neurological facts but through human thought.


# Blair White #
Let’s visit some of the “transmedicalist” ideas, through the main propagator Blaire White

(A bit of an aside but I found it interesting in her [video with Shane Dawson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAv0DSfmEUA) that she describes herself as being depressed (alienated) and taking it out on her father by saying mean things to him, and how she wishes she could go back and be nicer now that her dad is dead. Her political position fits this mission perfectly, an attempt to be nicer to her father (patriarchal authority))

In her video about [Nikkie Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33HGY6-9IRE) she describes a scene where her trans roommate faced some wrath from a man who didn’t know that she was trans until after they had hooked up. After this recognition the man began to yell and act violently, to the point where the police needed to be called to remove him. Blaire White makes a pretty simple plea here, transphobic men are a force of nature that simply must be avoided, so for your own safety try to sort them out early by conveying that you are trans.

To many this sounds very similar to self-policing that women are encouraged to do to prevent themselves from being raped. The argument is obvious, trans women shouldn’t have to live in a world where they are in fear of violent aggression from men, White’s response would be here, that this is the world we live in and you need to act accordingly. While White doesn’t address men directly, the implicit message is that they are justified in violence when they are betrayed. A particular message, when conveyed in a universal format carries a universalist implication.
It’s easy to imagine that some trans women will react strongly in opposition to White’s message here, because it triggers gender dysphoria. Acknowledging the validity of straight men who don’t want to sleep with trans women, implies that trans women are still only men.

How do we move forward toward a better world? White suggests a fundamentally liberal solution, which is that trans women should be afforded equal rights on the understanding that they are women’s brains stuck in male bodies, but with assistance from society transform their bodies to match their gendered brains.

(Another aside I found an argument made by a [quora user](https://www.quora.com/How-would-a-man-know-that-he-had-intercourse-with-a-transgender-woman-if-she-doesnt-tell-him) stating that a post-op trans woman and a cis woman with a hysterectomy are (nearly) biologically identitical, including a female brain)

Contrapoints has criticized Blaire White in her videos through a thinly-veiled character known as Tiffany Tumbles. Suggesting that the move toward transmedicalism is one response that trans women have to internalized bigotry and dysphoria within the oppressive gender ideology.

In the contrapoints video transtrenders she poses 3 theories of gender:

1. Biological transmedicalist
2. Social performativity
3. Psychological identity

Each theory quickly runs into problems, so the character Justine proposes a leap of faith, to accept people's identities without need for a justification. She draws the comparison to love, it is impossible to prove and the attempt to do so is degrading and futile. However, I don’t see how this position is any different from a theory of psychological identity.

Gender seems to exist universally in all human societies, seemingly a result of differing roles in reproduction. The nature of reproduction divides humanity generally into two social roles, genders, although this divide doesn’t seem to be complete as the discovery of third gender positions indicates.

It isn’t clear to me right now if early humans understood gender as biologically based in sex, actually this idea seems to have arisen out of the modern development of biological science which replaced earlier religious or mystical theories.

Feminist analysis has focused on this original divide in humanity between different social roles as the source of inequality and oppression in society. Engels finds gender as instrumental in the foundation of private property.

Understanding the subjectivity of gender can borrow from german idealism. The alienation of the subject from themselves is key here, this was developed further in psychoanalysis. We are never our identities, there always remains a gap. Therefore we are never able to fully embody our gender.

Zizek analyzes the implications of transgender existence. Many trans people have fought to justify their existence relying on essentialist theories, “a woman’s mind in a man’s body”. On the other hand queer theorists pioneered a new understanding of gender as socially constructed, drawing on Judith Bulter how gender is a performance which gives the illusion of an essential gender which actually can’t be placed. Zizek seeks to transpose this contradiction inward, suggesting gender as an unconscious choice. He provides the example of falling in love as such an unconscious choice: we do not choose to fall in love, but can only retroactively discover that we have already made this choice which we consciously understand as predestined.

We should also take time to revisit his infamous article of 2016 which got him in quite a bit of trouble:

The existence of non-binary identities. As a starting place we can distinguish between stable and transitional non-binary identities. From pure experience it seems that many binary trans people inherently pass through a period of questioning, which often takes the form of adopting a temporary non-binary identity enroute to the opposite gender position. When people discuss this, it seems there is an implied inevitability, there is already an essential gender position which is yet to be discovered.
The existence of stable non-binary identities suggests that at some point the choice between man or woman has already been unconsciously rejected at some point

# Some Discourse #

<https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-transgender-people-the-basics>
“Gender identity is your internal knowledge of your gender – for example, your knowledge that you’re a man, a woman, or another gender. Gender expression is how a person presents their gender on the outside, often through behavior, clothing, hairstyle, voice or body characteristics.”

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVe8wpmH_lU>
6:30 binary is forced, experiences are varied, end to categorization of people, reclaim narratives
Reading the comments: gender isn’t a fashion statement, etc.
People who identify on the gender binary sometimes violate gender roles in their social context, and sometimes large social understandings of gender do change. However using a performative lens, and taking a leap of faith that non-binary identity is real, I think it’s easy to explain androgynous presentation as part of the establishment of a material basis in performativity for internal expression.

In the contrapoints video Justine offers the idea that even simply identifying as non-binary in language or asking for they/them pronouns is a material act of gender performativity, altering the semantic/symbolic realm.

(Is there an implication here that cis or binary people in general do not doubt their gender identity, or experience some kind of unity with it. It seems that instead we need to view all gender as traumatic, where identity is never able to map perfectly to existence. How much masculine aggression arises out of fundamental struggles with mapping existence with a male identity, is it like the fundamentalist move of establishing gender materially to shore up an internal lack?)


# Freud #

In his 1905 work, [Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex](http://Three_Contributions_to_the_Theory_of_Sex)

Actually there is a big change between his original 1905 and revised 1924 works. Verso has released the only english translation of the 1905 work, which lacks the oedipal theory <https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/3065-freud-s-missing-object-the-1905-edition-of-three-essays-on-the-theory-of-sexuality>


* “The popular theory of the sexual impulse corresponds closely to the poetic fable of dividing the person into two halves--man and woman--who strive to become reunited through love”
* He identifies 3 types of inverts or contrary sexuals. Absolutely inverted (complete homosexual), amphigenously inverted (complete bisexual), occasionally inverted (mostly straight). He also notes that sexual impulse is not stable but can develop at different points and experience changes.
* He identifies that inverts either embrace their sexual impulse as normal, or they struggle against it (he believes this can be solved with psychoanalysis)
* The discovery of bisexuality, by which freud means hermaphroditism or intersex, suggests that the view that only men and women exist is false. All people start biologically bisexual and develop toward monosexuality. This same process happens psychically.

# Transcending gender #

The gendered division of humanity is not whole. The concepts of man and woman cannot map perfectly to particular human beings. Some people work to switch their social position within gender ideology. The term gender outlaw has arisen for people who take a position that violates the gender binary. The emergence of the transgender movement opened up the rift between social gender and biological sex, which can not be undone. Out of this rift people emerged who chose the identity non-binary to designate their position as indepedent of the binary. Zizek argues that there is a fundamental lack in gender, out of which emerges to excess of other gender positions. Non-binary, not a positive identity but a pure negation, identifies directly with the lack in gender itself.

So what is the revolution which reconstitutes the nature of gender? The non-binary position is a fundamentally post-gender one, where everybody has their own particular gendered position, therefore nobody has one. The dialectical move here is to universalize the non-binary position to rupture the very frame of their existence.

# Transgender Psychoanalysis #

In *Transgender Psychoanalysis: A Lacanian Perspective on Sexual Difference* by Patricia Gherovici she lays out a psychoanalytic theory of sexual identity.

* She points out that Freud and Lacan understood the transgender position as a psychic not biological phonomenon, and that gender identity doesn’t fully map
* She talks about how gender and sex are inherently tied up in one embodiment
* Hysteria as the structure that questions “Am I a man or a woman?”
* A great review on some of her concepts in a [book review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5GDGwVlXObdMzBiclFPaTMwNFU/view) of *Please Select Your Gender*
