# Preface
My approach is based on the idea of historical materialism that I read from Marx. What he sought to do was to demonstrate how the ideas of his society were actually the necessary ideas which emerged from a particular economic order. Explaining this idea in detail is out of scope for this paper but this famous quote from Marx's 1859 Preface to A Critique of Political Economy serves as a commonly accepted concise summation of the concept.

> "In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or – this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure."

So when I look at the United States, China, or any other elements of our reality, my interest here is to understand their process of development, evaluate their current position, and consider future trajectories. I think for a proper assessment we need to consider the current period of human history, the meaning of human freedom and what are its primary obstacles.

My understanding is that capital, the particular process of accumulation that defines our era, is a unique threat not only to human freedom but maybe our very existence. This has an impact on my evaluation.

# Imperialism

While I can't do a thorough discussion of capital here, we do need to discuss the basic economic structure of the modern world.

By the time we arrive in the 20th century, capital had taken a unique shape, what we might refer to as monopoly capitalism or modern imperialism depending on what elements you want to emphasize. What's particular is that the centers of capitalism became powerful enough to dominate the economy and politics of most countries on the periphery. This consolidated the global division between the most and least developed countries to a group of great powers and their colonies. In 1884 Africa was partitioned up at the Conference of Berlin. In US History we usually think of the Spanish-American War in 1898 as the moment when this really happens.

With the emergence of imperialism the brewing class conflict in the imperialist countries reached a fever pitch, as worker militancy surged and socialist parties exploded in size. The history of this is complex but mostly this was resolved by capitalism through a series of compromises with labor that ultimately resolved in pacifying the revolutionary edge of this movement (despite attempts to opt for outright extermination in Italy, Germany, Spain etc)

The basis of personal freedom that exists in the West was mostly won in these battles, although essentially it is the freedom of the consumer within the market.


# Socialism
Socialism did successfully emerge in the Russian empire, unique in being the least developed of the core country. the history of soviet strategy over the 20th century as well as an evaluation of their socialist experiments at home are beyond what i can get into right now

One important aspect was the recognition of anti-colonial/anti-imperialist struggle as a primary way to strike blows at capitalism by depriving the primary capitalist centers of their colonies

China itself had been in its "century of humiliation" up to this point in history, when it finally emerged as sovereign as a result of its domestic revolution as well as significant soviet aid

The Chinese Revolution remains alive today in that it still maintains its two major achievements. National sovereignty and the liberation of the peasantry. This liberation is material fact which only takes a brief comparison with countries like India where the peasantry are still fundamentally enslaved to recognize the significance of.

The promise of the Chinese revolution, yet unfulfilled is the construction of socialist society. In the maoist era they adhered more closely to socialist planning, at the expense of development, of course which in modern china has been reversed. Either way the economic strategy was and does remain oriented toward establishing socialism


China does actually have a democracy, even if there are firm boundaries that are policed by the state. People organize protests, they speak their minds, vote, form organizations, etc. I'm not saying it is a particularly permissive society but all this does exist. China is generally considered by even western political scientists to have an exceptionally responsive administration, that is the government pays close attention to the people and answers their demands. This is why the approval rating of the government in China is exceptionally high, a fact recognized by even western scholars.


# American Liberty in the 20th Century
It's interesting to think through the development of American liberty in the 20th century

The new deal is really the definitive compromise with labor


ludlow, blair mountain, palmer raids, etc

fdr's great accomplishment was protecting the capitalist system from the worst elements of the capitalist class, who were basically set to drive it into the ground. The conversion of America's oppressed immigrant laboring class into citizens is such an important development, which only happened the way it did with the context of communism. Of course this deal for American workers took place simultaneously with the further subjugation of the people of latin america, who would be ultimately pushed toward violent resistance later in the century.

Just that civil rights is also rooted in cold war decision making by Eisenhower to enforce brown v board

It's interesting to think through what happened in the 60s and 70s in America. Resolving the issue of segregation, and ultimately black freedom as a whole, with the struggle over the war in vietnam.

Following ww2 the future of imperialism was largely in question as colonialism everywhere began its collapse. there's simply too much history to really recount here but you want to think about the Afro-Asian Conference of 1955 in Indonesia, the Algerian war of independence, the Cuban Revolution, etc
Segregation was colonialism and the struggle against it was part and parcel of this movement. The charges of genocide brought to the UN by african americans is illustrative of how this fit into the global situation
the case of Vietnam i think is obvious enough

All the gains for personal freedom and liberty in the west in this period (which really climaxes in 1968-1973) can really only be understood in this light. the entire modern lgbt movement directly emerged from these anti-colonial struggles which is clear when you study the Gay Liberation Front
just as one example
