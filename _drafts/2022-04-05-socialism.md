# Preface
## Historical Materialism
My approach is based on the idea of historical materialism that I read from Marx. What he was able to demonstrate was how the ideas of his society were actually the necessary ideas of a particular economic order. Explaining this idea in detail is out of scope for this paper but this famous quote from Marx's 1859 Preface to A Critique of Political Economy serves as a concise summary of the concept.

> "In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or – this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure."

## Evaluating the United States and China
So when I look at the United States, China, or any other elements of our reality, my process is to understand the nature of their development, evaluate their current position, and consider future trajectories. I think for a proper assessment we need to consider the current period of human history, the meaning of human freedom and its primary obstacles.

My understanding is that capital, the particular process of accumulation that defines our era, is a unique threat not only to human freedom but maybe our very existence.

# Imperialism

While I can't do a thorough discussion of capital here, we do need to discuss the basic economic structure of the modern world.

By the time we arrive in the 20th century, capital had reached a new stage of development, referred to in the literature as monopoly capitalism or modern imperialism. At this stage the centers of capitalism, primarily located in America and Europe, became powerful enough to dominate the economy and politics of most countries on the periphery. This consolidated the global division between the most and least developed countries to a group of great powers and their colonies. To understand this we can look at 1884 when Africa was partitioned up at the Conference of Berlin. In US history we usually think of the Spanish-American War in 1898 as the moment when this really happens. On the economic side this was marked by the rise of monopoly corporations, such as Standard Oil, US Steel and Union Pacific.

With the Second Industrial Revolution emerged a mass urban working class to labor in production. All of these conditions led to intensifying class conflict, including union militancy and socialist political organization. The history of this struggle is complex but ultimately it was resolved by capitalism through a series of compromises with labor which pacifying the revolutionary energy of this movement. In Italy and Germany a failed attempt was made to pacify this movement by force and extermination.

# Socialism
Socialism did emerge in the Russian empire, which was either the least developed core country or the most developed peripheral country depending on how you look at it. the history of soviet strategy over the 20th century as well as an evaluation of their socialist experiments at home are beyond what i can get into right now

One important aspect was the recognition of anti-colonial/anti-imperialist struggle as a primary way to strike blows at capitalism by depriving the primary capitalist centers of their colonies

China itself had been in its "century of humiliation" up to this point in history, when it finally emerged as sovereign as a result of its domestic revolution as well as significant soviet aid

The Chinese Revolution remains alive today in that it still maintains its two major achievements. National sovereignty and the liberation of the peasantry. This liberation is material fact which only takes a brief comparison with countries like India where the peasantry are still fundamentally enslaved to recognize the significance of.

The promise of the Chinese revolution, yet unfulfilled is the construction of socialist society. In the maoist era they adhered more closely to socialist planning, at the expense of development, of course which in modern china has been reversed. Either way the economic strategy was and does remain oriented toward establishing socialism


China does actually have a democracy, even if there are firm boundaries that are policed by the state. People organize protests, they speak their minds, vote, form organizations, etc. I'm not saying it is a particularly permissive society but all this does exist. China is generally considered by even western political scientists to have an exceptionally responsive administration, that is the government pays close attention to the people and answers their demands. This is why the approval rating of the government in China is exceptionally high, a fact recognized by even western scholars.


# American Liberty in the 20th Century
It's interesting to think through the development of American liberty in the 20th century

The new deal is really the definitive compromise with labor. 

The beginning of the 20th century was marked with fierce and often violent labor conflicts. 

ludlow, blair mountain, palmer raids, etc

fdr's great accomplishment was protecting the capitalist system from the worst elements of the capitalist class, who were basically set to drive it into the ground. The conversion of America's oppressed immigrant laboring class into citizens is such an important development, which only happened the way it did with the context of communism. Of course this deal for American workers took place simultaneously with the further subjugation of the people of latin america, who would be ultimately pushed toward violent resistance later in the century.

Just that civil rights is also rooted in cold war decision making by Eisenhower to enforce brown v board

It's interesting to think through what happened in the 60s and 70s in America. Resolving the issue of segregation, and ultimately black freedom as a whole, with the struggle over the war in vietnam.

Following ww2 the future of imperialism was largely in question as colonialism everywhere began its collapse. there's simply too much history to really recount here but you want to think about the Afro-Asian Conference of 1955 in Indonesia, the Algerian war of independence, the Cuban Revolution, etc
Segregation was colonialism and the struggle against it was part and parcel of this movement. The charges of genocide brought to the UN by african americans is illustrative of how this fit into the global situation
the case of Vietnam i think is obvious enough

All the gains for personal freedom and liberty in the west in this period (which really climaxes in 1968-1973) can really only be understood in this light. the entire modern lgbt movement directly emerged from these anti-colonial struggles which is clear when you study the Gay Liberation Front
just as one example
