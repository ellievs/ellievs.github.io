On Sunday January 23rd [hundreds of people][aldergrove] in the town of Aldergrove, British Columbia[^1] cheered from an overpass as a long line of trucks passed underneath on Hwy 1. Many of the residents were carrying Canadian flags and several held signs with messages including “F\*ck Trudeau,” “F\*ck the Mandate,” and “Freedom Fighters.” They had gathered to see the Freedom Convoy 2022 on its way to the Canadian capital of Ottawa to protest a Covid-19 vaccine mandate for cross border truckers. The country was soon to see the city occupied for weeks on end, blockades formed on several major border crossings, and the invocation of unprecedented federal emergency laws.

Announced during the Omicron variant wave of the Covid-19 Pandemic, the [new policy][mandate-policy] which took effect on January 15th requires Canadian truckers crossing the Canada/U.S. border to present proof of vaccination or a negative PCR test collected within 72 hours. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) passed a similar requirement which took effect on January 22nd. The implementation of stay at home orders, business restrictions, and mask mandates had previously provoked protests across the country in 2020 and 2021 with mass rallies from [Calgary][mandate-protest-calgary] to [Ottawa][mandate-protest-ottawa], including a [previous convoy][anti-mask-convoy] to the capital against mask mandates in April 2021.

Plans for a new convoy began emerging online in early January 2022, which crystallized around a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=104058065518969&amp;id=100286905896085">Facebook page</a> and GoFundMe created by <a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/who-is-tamara-lich-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire">Tamara Lich</a>, under the name “Freedom Convoy 2022” on January 20th. Lich, an organizer with the right-wing western separatist Maverick Party, would emerge as the main spokesperson and leader of the convoy movement. Routes were organized on the <a href="https://freedomconvoycanada.com/bearhug">official website</a>, which would bring participants from as far as Prince Rupert, British Columbia and St. Johns, Newfoundland and Labrador.

## Western Alienation to Wexit

<p align="center">
  <a href="/img/convoy/canada-2019-federal-elections.png"><img width="600" src="/img/convoy/canada-2019-federal-elections.png" /></a>
</p>

Following the 2019 election the ruling Liberal Party won a plurality of seats allowing them to stay in power through a minority government, despite losing the popular vote to the Conservative Party. The reelection of Justin Trudeau and his party led to significant anger in Canada’s Western Provinces which led to “Wexit” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706204239/https://election.ctvnews.ca/ottawa-doesn-t-care-western-separatist-movement-gains-traction-as-albertans-react-to-liberal-victory-1.4649487">trending</a> on Twitter and <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6127133/alberta-saskatechewan-ipsos-poll-separatism/">record high polling</a> in support of separatism in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. While the term Wexit–the proposed separation of the Western provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba from Canada–has only recently emerged, the west has long been home to separatist attitudes.

Driving separatism is the perception of political and economic favoritism shown toward the eastern provinces, known as “western alienation.” This can be demonstrated through the conflict between the western provinces and the eastern-dominated federal government over natural resources, particularly of the large reserves of oil and gas in the west.

<p align="center">
  <a href="img/convoy/oil-sands-map.png"><img height="600" src="/img/convoy/oil-sands-map.png" /></a>
</p>

Originally home to a relatively poor agriculture-based economy, Alberta was suddenly transformed following the <a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SY9VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0j8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1700,1104312">discovery</a> of major crude oil reserves at Leduc, Alberta in 1947. This led to a significant oil boom in the western provinces as companies invested great sums to explore and begin extraction of this valuable resource. Notable was the discovery of massive <a href="https://www.capp.ca/oil/what-are-the-oil-sands/">oil sands</a> deposits, a mixture of sand, water and heavy bitumen oil that can be expensive to extract and process. At an estimated 165.4 billion barrels of accessible crude oil, Alberta contains the fourth largest deposit in the world and is currently the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=43995">largest single source</a> of US energy inputs. This western-based Canadian oil and gas industry employs about 160,000 people and contributes about $100 billion to Canada’s GDP, making it central to the country’s economy.

Alberta would become a wealthy province with this <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2005/12/03/alienating-the-west">oil extraction</a> based economy, particularly in the 1970s as oil prices reached new heights. However, tension with the east would also peak in 1980 when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau–father of the current Prime Minister–implemented the National Energy Program (NEP) which centralized control of Canada’s oil resources and controlled oil prices. Taking effect at the same time as the early 1980s global recession and a worldwide fall in oil prices Alberta was hit hard with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226211533/http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/11-624-MIE/11-624-MIE2006015.pdf">bankruptcies and foreclosures</a> that rattled the province. While Trudeau’s government would retract the policy within a few years, it was seen as just the <a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/opinion/2020/11/21/the-national-energy-programs-bitter-aftertaste-has-lasted-40-years-and-provided-a-hard-lesson-to-ottawa.html">latest violation</a> of the western provinces’ sovereignty by the east.

These feelings of western alienation would give rise to the western-based Reform Party in 1987, which ran on the motto “The West Wants In.” In the 1993 election the ruling Progressive Conservative party faced its greatest defeat, as the Reform Party became the largest right-wing party in Parliament. By 2003 the two parties would merge to form the modern Conservative Party of Canada, although tension over the representation of western interests would still remain.

The decline of oil prices that started in 2014 saw oil and gas jobs eliminated in Alberta as <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-wages-recession-tombe-1.5229086">earnings dropped</a> throughout the province. Combined with the election of Trudeau’s liberal party in 2015, feelings of western alienation are once again emerging.

## The Convoy Approaches Ottawa

As the convoy pulled into <a href="https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/truck-convoy-organizer-raises-over-3-8m-protest-draws-support-and-criticism-1.5752185">Calgary</a>, Alberta they were greeted by hundreds of supporters late on Sunday January 23rd. In the morning well over a thousand people cheered the truckers as they left to continue their way east. By night the convoy had reached <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8536302/freedom-convoy-trucks-regina-ottawa/">Regina</a>, Saskatchewan where they were also greeted by a crowd of supporters including the former Conservative Party leader and current MP Andrew Scheer. Regina Police <a href="https://www.baytoday.ca/business/trucker-convoy-continues-east-to-winnipeg-after-making-overnight-stop-near-regina-4991652">estimated</a> there were about 1200 trucks in the convoy. Passing through the small town of <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2022/02/01/truck-convoy-passes-through-moosomin.html">Moosomin</a> near the Manitoba border the trucks were again greeted by over 1000 people.

A similar scene appeared again and again in each city as the convoy continued to snake its way eastward toward Ottawa. While the convoy was on the move, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and Canadian Manufacturing Coalition <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8535295/truckers-vaccine-mandate-business-groups/">began pressuring</a> Trudeau to back down on the vaccine requirement, noting the economic damage and supply chain shortages caused by the policy.

However, it is unclear if ending the mandate would have prevented the convoy, which had already become a lightning rod for a variety of right-wing grievances. Speaking from his truck, convoy organizer Chris Barber from Saskatchewan <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bigred19755/video/7055071690983836933?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id7035068654710720005">spoke to his TikTok</a> followers: “If he cancels this mandate all this bullshit with the vaccine tomorrow. Question is, are we going to Ottawa? You know what, the state of the affairs in Canada right now, I see a lot of shit that bugs me. The carbon tax is number 1, that’s money that we don’t have\[…\] In Canada we’re taxed to fucking death, it’s enough.”

In 2015 Justin Trudeau ran on a platform <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/3097871/fact-check-justin-trudeau-break-promise-approving-pipelines/">promising</a> a gradual transition away from fossil fuels and toward green energy. To that end he promised a <a href="https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/what-justin-trudeaus-election-means-for-energy-and-the-environment-in-canada/">carbon tax</a>, restricted pipeline construction and the eventual phasing out of oil sands extraction. It was the implementation of this carbon tax which had led truckers to convoy to Ottawa in 2019, and would have certainly been on the minds of many of the truckers who made their way to the capital once more.

Trudeau, <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8539610/trucker-convoy-covid-vaccine-mandates-ottawa/">speaking to the media</a>, refused to back down on the vaccine mandate, criticizing the Conservative Party for “fear mongering” and dismissed the convoy as a “fringe minority.” The convoy would continue onward, and would near the capital within a few days.

## The Occupation of Ottawa

<p align="center">
  <a href="/img/convoy/sat-jan-29.jpg"><img width="600" src="/img/convoy/sat-jan-29.jpg" /></a>
</p>

Thursday January 27th, as the convoy approached the capital, Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole offered to meet with the convoy’s leaders privately to discuss their concerns, but held back from endorsing the protest or its aims.

However, out on the streets to greet the convoy was Derek Sloan, leader of the small right-wing Ontario Party. A candidate for Conservative Party leadership in 2020, Sloan was later expelled under the leadership of his victorious opponent MP O'Toole, who alleged Sloan had accepted donations from neo-nazi Paul Fromm. Sloan is known for his socially conservative views, including his opposition to LGBT rights and making xenophobic remarks. In 2020 he had criticized the Liberal government’s slow response to indigenous anti-pipeline protesters, who he called “radical extremists”. Following his expulsion from the party, he has been a frequent participant in the anti-lockdown movement, speaking at rallies across Ontario.

Also present as trucks and people converged on Parliament Hill was Maxime Bernier of the People’s Party. Also a former Conservative Party leadership candidate, he was the frontrunner in 2017 before losing narrowly to Andrew Scheer. Self-identifying as an “Albertan from Quebec” and known to his colleagues in Ottawa as “Mad Max,” he ran on a libertarian platform of deregulation and cutting taxes. After his loss he formed the small right-wing People's Party and has been a vocal critic of the Liberal government’s Covid-19 policy.

Saturday January 29th was the peak of the protest movement, bringing Ottawa to complete gridlock as the streets were filled with about 9,000 protesters and hundreds of trucks. Trudeau fled the downtown area citing security concerns and proceeded to work virtually from a private residence. The Ottawa police began racking up a $800,000 a day bill as they monitored the protest with minimal intervention. While many of the city’s residents complained of the noisy and rowdy protesters that filled their city and blocked their roads, no significant acts of violence or destruction were reported.

<p align="center">
  <a href="/img/convoy/coutts-blockade.jpg"><img width="600" src="/img/convoy/coutts-blockade.jpg" /></a>
</p>

While the convoy was settling down for their first night of occupation, back in Alberta 100s of trucks were making their way toward a second target. The village of Coutts sits on the Canadian side of a major border crossing into the U.S. state of Montana, and is the site of about $44 million worth of trade every day. This second convoy faced little resistance when they arrived and proceeded to blockade the route.

Back in Ottawa residents waking up Sunday morning find that the protest has turned into occupation with the convoy and protesters taking up temporary residence on Parliament Hill. Bernier would lead his own march, where he expressed his support for the movement, his opposition to the mandates and restrictions, and a criticism of O’Toole for not attending the protest.

## Pipelines

<p align="center">
  <a href="/img/convoy/coastal-gaslink-pipeline.jpg"><img width="600" src="/img/convoy/coastal-gaslink-pipeline.jpg" /></a>
</p>

The Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation Chief issued a <a href="https://www.acfn.com/single-post/statement-from-athabasca-chipewyan-first-nation-chief-and-council-on-coutts-border-crossing-blockade">statement</a> condemning what they saw as a double standard in Alberta’s government response to the blockade at Coutts to indigenous anti-pipeline protests.

The <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coastal-gaslink-crossing-hundreds-waterways-1.5917474">Coastal GasLink</a> pipeline is a natural gas pipeline currently being constructed in British Columbia. A $6.6 billion project, the pipeline would carry gas harvested from fracking in Dawson’s Creek in Northeastern BC and bring it to Kitimat near the coast for export to Asian markets. The pipeline would cross 625 waterways in Northern B.C. and through the territory of the indigenous Wet’suwet’en Nation. The hereditary chiefs of the Nation objected to the pipeline’s construction, pointing to the environmental dangers posed by pipeline and the connection between pipeline construction camps and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/155367/connection-pipelines-sexual-violence">sexual violence</a> against indigenous women.

Over the years <a href="https://unistoten.camp/no-pipelines/background-of-the-campaign/">several pipelines</a> had been proposed which would cross Wet’suwet’en land, including the Pacific Trails natural gas pipeline and the Northern Gateway pipeline which would carry oil sands from Alberta. A camp was built on the traditional Unist’ot’en Territory at the exact point where these pipelines would cross. In February 2020 RCMP officers would <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/03/09/news/coastal-gaslink-broke-bc-pipeline-rules-more-50-times">raid</a> the Unist’ot’en camps and arrest the Wet’suwet’en who resided there. Solidarity protests would erupt across the country, with activists blockading railroads as a primary tactic.

Activists in Alberta had acted in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en by blocking a CN rail line west of Edmonton, causing hundreds of trains to be canceled. While Kenney’s government <a href="https://thenarwhal.ca/coutts-border-blockade/">introduced</a> a new law which would impose harsh penalties for blockades, it was not invoked to deal with the latest blockade at Coutts.

Instead the Albertan government and federal police would allow the blockade at Coutts to continue for weeks without interference.

## Conservative Party Reorients

On Monday January 31st, MP Bob Benzen <a href="https://theweek.com/election/1009707/erin-otoole-ousted-as-leader-of-canadas-conservative-party">called for a vote</a> to remove Erin O’Toole. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/BobBenzen/status/1488308784703414272/photo/1">letter</a> he listed 4 reasons: the controversial reversal on the carbon tax policy, failure to repeal the 2020 firearms law, his hands off stance on Bill 96 which restricted official use of English in Quebec, and unclear stance on covid-19 policies.

While protesters were settling in Wednesday for another night on Parliament Hill, inside the Conservative Party proceeded with their vote to <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/erin-otoole-ousted-as-leader-of-the-conservative-party">remove</a> Erin O'Toole from leadership. In the 2020 Conservative Party leadership contest the Ontario-based MP had emerged victorious with the <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/corbella-wexit-suffered-a-blow-with-the-election-of-otoole-as-tory-leader">support of the west</a> despite <a href="https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2020/09/09/erin-otoole-has-his-work-cut-out-for-him-in-western-canada.html">facing some criticism</a> from the far right populists. As leader however he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/20/world/canada/the-conservative-erin-otoole-shifted-left-to-broaden-his-partys-appeal.html">anger conservatives</a> in the west over his support for a ban on conversion therapy and softening his position on the carbon tax. O’Toole had mostly stood aside from the Freedom Convoy and the previous anti-lockdown protests that had swept the country. Failing to make gains in the 2021 Federal Election, he had been deemed out of touch with the party base.

The party selected Manitoba-based Candice Bergen to serve as interim leader, a former cabinet minister who had been condemned for sporting a MAGA hat last year. Before his ouster she had urged O’Toole to support the Freedom Convoy as a means of attacking Trudeau. However party rules would limit Bergen from seeking party leadership at the upcoming convention.

## Demands and Funds

On Thursday the Freedom Convoy 2022 organizers held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVuWFCuWYrY">press conference</a> to state their demands, affirm their commitment to a peaceful protest and confirm their close cooperation with Ottawa Police.. Tamara Lich spoke, “We are calling on all levels of government in Canada to end all Covid mandates and restrictions. We will continue our protest until we see a clear plan for their elimination.”

Another issue discussed at the press conference was the status of the convoy’s official GoFundMe page. Over the course of the convoy and protests the fundraiser had received about C$10 million, although GoFundMe had only allowed C$1 million to be dispersed. Following the press conference the fundraiser would be canceled following efforts by the Canadian government to stop it. Organizers would turn to the Christian fundraising site GiveSendGo, which was targeted by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice who <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10508291/Bank-freezes-Freedom-Convoy-supporters-accounts-crowd-fundraising-site-says-defy-order.html">barred the dispersal of funds</a> to the convoy, leading the donations to be frozen by the Toronto-Dominion Bank.

The data of the GiveSendGo fundraiser would later be <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/convoy-protest-donations-data-1.6351292">leaked</a>, revealing that the majority of donations came from the United States, although a majority of the money did originate in Canada.

Speaking <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60251921">to the media</a> on Friday February 4th, Trudeau told the protesters to “go home”, but indicated that he had received no requests for military assistance and had no plans to deploy the military.

## Occupation continues and new blockades emerge

<p align="center">
  <a href="/img/convoy/toronto-feb-5.png"><img width="600" src="/img/convoy/toronto-feb-5.png" /></a>
</p>

While protesters in Ottawa were planning for their second weekend at the capital, across the country protests were being organized. On Saturday February 5th, thousands protested in <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8597373/toronto-trucker-convoy-demonstration-feb-5/">Toronto</a> at Queen’s park and downtown near the Ontario legislative building where trucks and protesters took to the streets blocking traffic. Thousands also gathered in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/world/canada/truck-convoy-protests.html">Quebec City</a> as dozens of trucks blocked downtown streets near the Quebec legislature, while in <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/vancouver-protest-the-city-and-its-roads-are-under-seige-by-duelling-protests">Vancouver</a> counter-protesters attempted to block a local truck convoy from reaching downtown.

The occupation in <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/truck-convoy-weekend-1.6340533">Ottawa</a> saw another surge of protesters, with about 5,000 people packed the streets once again. By now an encampment had arisen in Confederation Park, while police reported investigations into 50 criminal offenses including hate crimes. Police reported 28 vehicles associated with the protest had been towed. Chair Diane Deans of the Ottawa Police Services Board called the protest a “nationwide insurrection” and Police Chief Peter Sloly called for a surge of resources to end the protest. On Sunday, the Mayor of Ottawa Jim Watson declared a state of emergency, faced with the prospect of a city indefinitely occupied and blockaded by the convoy.

Also on Saturday right-wing populist Ottawa-area MP <a href="https://theweek.com/election/1009833/populist-pierre-poilievre-seeks-leadership-of-canadas-conservative-party">Pierre Poilievre</a> announced his intention to run for Conservative Party leadership. The Calgary-born MP had been vocal in speaking out against what <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-already-it-looks-like-no-conservative-will-be-able-to-challenge-pierre/">he called</a> the “vaccine vendetta against our hard-working truckers” and had been a firm <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1996667971692">supporter</a> of the Freedom Convoy. Popular with the party base, he is expected to win leadership of the Conservative Party at their upcoming convention.

On Monday February 7th, speaking to the Ottawa City Council, Police Chief Sloly requested resources for hiring <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/07/world/canada-trucker-protest">1800 additional</a> police officers in Ottawa in order to end the protest. That evening NDP leader Jagmeet Singh called for an <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/emergency-debate-justin-trudeau-freedom-convoy">emergency debate</a> in Parliament centered around how to deal with the protest. In the House of Commons Trudeau, making his first public appearance since the start of the protests, spoke calling for an end to the occupation and for the restoration of order.

While the police in Ottawa slowly began to make arrests, the protesters had already selected a new target. On Monday night a convoy <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/ambassador-bridge-protest-1.6342837">occupied</a> the Ambassador Bridge which connects Windsor, Ontario to Detroit, Michigan. As the single most important border crossing between the United States and Canada, $300 million worth of goods are transported by about 10,000 trucks over this bridge everyday. Faced with this escalation, Ontario Premier Doug Ford <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/ambassador-bridge-protest-third-day-windsor-1.6344647">spoke out</a>, calling for an end to the “illegal occupation and blockade” and offering any he could offer to local police to clear the bridge. However, Windsor Police Chief Parn Mizuno said there was little police could do to forcibly remove the protesters without potentially provoking violence.

By Wednesday morning <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/truck-protests-blocking-highway-402-border-1.6344768">another blockade</a> had been set up with 20 tractors on the highway leading to Sarnia’s Bluewater Bridge that links Ontario to Port Huron, Michigan.

By Thursday GM, Toyota, Ford and Chrysler had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/gm-cancels-two-shifts-lansing-plant-following-canadian-trucking-protests-2022-02-10/">cut production</a> at auto plants as a result of the Ambassador Bridge blockade. Ford called for a quick resolution, indicating that a continued blockade would have a significant disruptive effect on all automakers in the U.S. and Canada.

Police begin negotiations on February 10th and succeed in having some trucks agree to leave the bridge. Back in Ottawa protesters continued to spread chaos with a protest disrupting the Ottawa airport. Yet another border blockade emerged at the Manitoba/North Dakota crossing, once again shutting down a trade route with little resistance.

Candice Bergen reverses her position and begins calling for an end to the protests at this point.

While Ontario declared a state of Emergency on February 11th, police began to clear trucks from the bridge. In a talk between Biden and Trudeau, the U.S. President makes clear his demand for the blockade to be ended quickly.

In Ottawa protesters have gathered for the 3rd weekend on February 12th, bringing out about 4,000 protesters, and once again experiencing minimal police action.

On the Ambassador bridge the police initially struggle to control the crowds that take over after the trucks have left, but by Sunday afternoon the bridge has been returned to normal functionality.

## Final Crackdown on the Movement

On Monday February 14th Justin Trudeau <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-premiers-cabinet-1.6350734">announced </a>that he would invoke the Emergencies Act for the first time in history in response to the convoy movement. The Emergencies Act had <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/commentary/doc/1991CanLIIDocs129#!fragment//BQCwhgziBcwMYgK4DsDWszIQewE4BUBTADwBdoByCgSgBpltTCIBFRQ3AT0otokLC4EbDtyp8BQkAGU8pAELcASgFEAMioBqAQQByAYRW1SYAEbRS2ONWpA">replaced the</a> War Measures Act which was repealed following criticism of its invocation by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau after the kidnapping of prominent government officials by the Front de libération du Québec in October 1970. Later that evening the RCMP carried out 13 <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8618494/alberta-coutts-border-protest-weapons-ammunition-seized/">arrests at the Coutts border blockade</a>, confiscating a cache of guns, ammunition and body armor in the process. By Wednesday <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/using-force-to-end-protests-is-up-to-police-pm-says-amid-concerns-over-what-s-next-in-ottawa-1.5783768">all four blockades</a>, at Coutts, Alberta, Surrey, B.C., Windsor, Ontario and Emerson, Manitoba, had all been cleared.

On Wednesday morning in Ottawa police began to <a href="https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ottawa-police-hand-out-leaflets-warning-downtown-protesters-to-leave-1.5783044">hand out notices</a> which threatened criminal charges for any demonstrators who continued to block streets in the city.

On Thursday Parliament <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/emergencies-act-debate-1.6354908">debated </a>Trudeau’s invocation of the Emergencies Act, as the Liberal Party prepared to hold a vote on approving the special measures to end the protests. Conservative MPs and Bloc Quebecois stood opposed to use of the act, but Trudeau achieved the cautious support of the NDP, sufficient for approval. Back on the streets of Ottawa, police <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/ottawa-police-arrest-convoy-organizers-but-others-remain-defiant-1.5785073">began arresting</a> some convoy protesters, taking Tamara Lich and Chris Barber away in handcuffs. As police began to clear vehicles and protesters they set up over 100 checkpoints to limit access to the downtown core.

On Friday the House of Commons <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/house-of-commons-sitting-cancelled-as-police-ready-action-on-protesters-in-ottawa-1.5786611">canceled</a> their sitting in preparation for a police crackdown against Ottawa occupation. Police launched a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/police-action-convoy-protest-1.6356444">major operation</a> moving toward Parliament Hill clearing out the protesters one-by-one. All who refused to move were handcuffed and loaded onto buses. Protest organizer Pat King was arrested along with a total of 76 others. Tamara Lich was charged with “counselling to commit the offence of mischief” while Chris Barber was charged with “counselling to commit mischief”, “counselling to commit the offence of disobeying a court order”, and “counselling to obstruct police.”

The <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/police-action-convoy-protest-1.6356444">police operation</a> continued late into the night as protesters at the occupation site resisted. Despite some minor clashes the police line advanced into the occupation's core on parliament hill with over 100 people arrested by the end of the day. Police action <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/ottawa-police-push-ahead-to-end-trucker-convoy-protest-more-arrests-made-1.5788319">continued</a> throughout the weekend and included the use of pepper spray and the use of ARWEN "less than lethal" bullets on protesters.

On Monday Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held a press conference where he called for Parliament to approve the invocation of the Emergencies Act

"We did not want to use the Emergencies Act. It is never something to turn to without serious consideration. But after weeks of dangerous and unlawful activities, after weeks of people being harassed in their neighborhood and small businesses forced to close, after billions of dollars stalled in trade putting people's jobs and livelihoods at risk. After the national war memorial was desecrated. After evidence of increased ideologically motivated violent extremism activity across the country. After a flood of misinformation and disinformation washed over Canada, including from foreign sources. After these illegal blockades and occupations received disturbing amounts of foreign funding to destabilize Canada's democracy, it became clear that local and provincial authorities needed more tools to restore order and keep people safe."

With the support of Trudeau Liberal Party and the NDP, use of the Emergencies Act was approved by a vote of 185 to 151.
